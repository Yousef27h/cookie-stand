Hello and welcome to my new project. My name is Yousef Salem, I'm Currently enrolled in an intensive course in Software Development which is provided by Abdul Aziz Ghurair School of Advanced Computing (ASAC) in collaboration with Code Fellows Academy in Seattle – US. This repository contains my Salmon Cookies project work during code201 course.  


This project idea came out of a business idea by combining two signature Seattle icons: Salmon & Cookies and was called Salmon Cookies. These cookies made into the shape of a salmon that has just a hint of fishy goodness.  


Salmon Cookies needs to calculate the number of cookies each location must make every day so that it can manage its supplies inventory and baking schedule. The number of cookies to make depends on the hours of operation (6:00 AM to 8:00 PM for all locations) and a few factors unique to each location.
